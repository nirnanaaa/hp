  <h1>How I got into programming</h1>
  <p>
    I got my first computer when I was a mere eight years old.
    This lead into a variety of experiments as you probably can imagine.
    My first contact with programming, was actually not actually with a programming language.
    I started out with basic HTML programming - as probably many children out there - and grew my way slowly into more advanced web development.
